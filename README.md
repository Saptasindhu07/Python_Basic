# Python_Basic
These are the codes I wrote while learning python from scratch until Object Oriented Programming in Python.

These codes include Basic Problems involving Numbers, Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, Nested Iterables and solving some Problems of Moderate Difficulty Related to those. 

The Latter half include Functions, Classes, Objects, Decorators and a few small projects like a restaurant service project created using Object Oriented Programming.
